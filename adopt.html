				  <p>
				  <ul>
					<li><b>Be realistic about your animal needs</b> - A puppy may not be the best choice if you are away from home.</li>
					<li><b>Your energy levels compared with your pet matters</b> - A fish will have more energy then a lizard. Animals have different energy levels, make sure that the pet matches within your energy boundaries.</li>
					<li><b>Does your pet play nice with others?</b> - Pets are bound to imprint on you, it is imperative to make sure that the those around you and your pet are safe.</li>
					<li><b>Think of your future</b> - Parrots live a lifetime.</li>
					<li><b>Consider your own needs</b> - Fur, scales, scratching, feathers, tanks that needs cleaning, etc. If that doesn't mesh well with you, that pet may not be the best choice. </li>
					<li><b>Pets may act differently after adoption</b> - All animals adapt to different surroundings. Pounds are different than <i>your</i> home.</li>
				  </ul>
