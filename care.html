        <ol>
          <li>Acclimation: When a pet is adopted into a new home, he or she will need time to adjust. A shy pet can have a difficult time transitioning into a new environment. Be sure to give your pet time to adjust to a small space in your home until they feel totally comfortable and can explore the rest of the house. Be patient, and move slowly and gently around your new pet! </li>
          <li>Play: Dogs and cats alike usually love to play. Playing helps them get rid any nervous energy that may have built up, so make sure to spend an hour or two each day socializing your new petâ€”squeaky mice, feather wands, and catnip make cats go wild, while peanut-butter filled bones, coiled ropes, and balls provide entertainment for dogs.</li>
          <li>Food and Treats: Growing puppies and kittens need more calories and nutrients than adult pets and should be fed three to six times per day with food specifically formulated for puppies/kittens. Larger breeds can be fed three to four times daily, while toy breeds should be fed more frequently (four to six times daily) to reduce the potential for low blood sugar. As puppies mature, the feeding frequency can be reduced. After reaching adulthood, feeding twice daily is commonly recommended for healthy pets.</li>
